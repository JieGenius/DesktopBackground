# DesktopBackground
An unfinished program that runs underneath all other programs to simulate a dynamic desktop. No plans on finishing.

Anyone has any desire to use any part of this project is more than welcome to.

BackgroundEarth.cs was started by copying from the BackgroundWallpaper.cs and I was going to modify it to feature a gif of the earth spinning, but never finished.
BackgroundPong.cs is in a primitive state and while it does work, it doesn't feel as visually appealing as I wanted originally.

Usage:
The program runs in the taskbar where right clicking the...generic icon...will allow you to select one of four modes.
There is also a small white triangle at the bottom center of the main screen where you can select modes as well.

I would like to note that the darksouls gif is not my art and was made by ZedoTagger (http://zedotagger.tumblr.com/post/120670458690/did-this-partially-as-background-and-lighting)

The two regions at the top of MainForm.cs are also not my code and were found on a stack overflow post that I have since lost.
